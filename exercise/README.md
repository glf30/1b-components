# Components Exercise

![Exercise Preview](./goldfish-final.png)

## Exercise overview

We are going to make a goldfish forum website page by combining different components each making up a different part of the page content.

## Set Up a New React Project
1. **Set Up Your Project:**
Create a new project with `npm create vite@latest`

## Install Bootstrap

4. Next let's import Bootstrap a front-end framework that provides CSS code to make our project beautiful. In terminal type `npm i bootstrap@5.2.3`. This will install the package into our project.

## Import Bootstrap

6. Then in VS Code, open the **/src/main.jsx** file and import the bootstrap css like by typing the following line `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';` placing it just after the import for ReactDOM and just before our import for **Index.css**. This way we can override the bootstrap styles with our own inside index.css if we wish to.

## Exercise Assets

7. Move the image files from the `assets` folder outside the project folder into the folder `public/`--this way the images will be accessible to your application.

**Each image should be in the `public` folder _directly_**, not in any other intermediate folder (not even in the `assets` folder)

## Applying CSS Classes

15. Erase the text "Hello World" from inside the `div`. Add the attribute `className=""` inside the `<div>` and give it the Bootstrap class name of `container-fluid`.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div className="container-fluid"></div>;
}
```

_Note: In the code above you can see I wrapped my JSX element inside `()` parenthesis. This acts as a grouping operator and simply allows us to not have to type a JSX tag on the same line as the `return` keyword. Instead we start our JSX on the next line. Some people prefer to write it this way so it looks cleaner, but it is not essential._

16. Inside the `<div>` lets create another two `<div>` and give them the Bootstrap class name of `row`. This will create our vertical separation between our header and the rest of the page.

I will also add some comments inside each div to make a note of what will eventually go there.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container-fluid">
      <div className="row">{/* Header will go here... */}</div>
      <div className="row">
        {/* Sidebar will go here... */}
        {/* Main Content will go here... */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Create Child Components

Let's create components for the Header, Sidebar, and Main content areas inside a `Components` folder.

17. From the File Explorer in the left panel, **right-click** on the **/src/** folder inside your project. Select **New File** and name the file `Header.jsx`.

18. Create another file in the same location and name it `Sidebar.jsx`.

19. Create another file in the same location and name it `Main.jsx`.

## Working on the Header

20. Inside the **/src/Header.jsx** file, start by importing React and creating a functional component.

21. Name the component `Header`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
    return (  );
}

export default Header;
```

22. Fill the empty return statement with `<header>`. Then add the Bootstrap class name `col-12` to `<header>`.

```jsx
<header className="col-12"></header>
```

23. Inside the `<header>` add an `<img />` element and give it the class name of `logo`. Set a src pointing to the url `src="/goldfish-logo.svg"`. Set the alt attribute `alt="GoldFish Logo"`.

```jsx
<header className="col-12">
  <img className="logo" src="/goldfish-logo.svg" alt="GoldFish Logo" />
</header>
```

24. Below the logo image create a heading `<h1>GoldFish Forum</h1>`

```jsx
function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="col-12">
      <img className="logo" src="/goldfish-logo.svg" alt="GoldFish Logo" />
      <h1>GoldFish Forum</h1>
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;
```

## Working on the Sidebar

25. Inside the **/src/Sidebar.jsx** file, start by importing React and creating a functional component.

26. Name the component Sidebar.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Sidebar(){
  return (

  );
}

export default Sidebar;
```

27. Fill the empty return statement with `<aside>`. Then add the Bootstrap class name `col-md-2` to `<aside>`.

```jsx
function Sidebar() {
  return <aside className="col-md-2"></aside>;
}
```

28. Inside the `<aside>` create a `<ul>` unordered list. Fill it with the following list items:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Forum</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>
```

Normally we would link these to the other views of our app but we will come back to **React Links** at another time. For now just leave them as just a list. Here is the finished Sidebar code.

```jsx
function Sidebar() {
  return (
    <aside className="col-md-2">
      <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Forum</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
  );
}

export default Sidebar;
```

## Working on the Main Content

29. Inside the **/src/Main.jsx** file, start by importing React and creating a functional component.

30. Name the component Main.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Main() {
  return (

  );
}

export default Main;
```

31. Fill the empty return statement with `<main>`. Then add the Bootstrap class name `col-md-10` to `<main>`.

```jsx
function Main() {
  return <main className="col-md-10"></main>;
}
```

32. Inside the `<main>` element add a `<div>` with an `<img />` inside of it. Below the `<div>` add a `<p>` paragraph.

```jsx
<main className="col-md-10">
  <div>
    <img />
  </div>
  <p></p>
</main>
```

33. Set the `<div>` the class name of `frame`

34. Set the `<img />`, `src=""` attribute to `/oranda.png` and the `alt=""` attribute set to `Oranda`.

35. Copy and Paste the following text into the `<p>`:

```txt
Fancy goldfish are interesting, fun additions to many tanks or ponds. However, they all have their own special needs and they can’t be kept with just any tank mates. It’s important to ensure you carefully choose tank mates for your fancies so avoid injury and stress. Some of them are weak swimmers or have poor vision, meaning they can easily be out competed for food and may not be able to escape bullying by other fish. Many fancies are becoming more popular in the aquatics trade, while others are rare enough that you may never see them in person. Each breed of fancy goldfish has its own charm and unique qualities, making them beautiful centerpieces for your tank.
```

Here is the updated code for Main:

```jsx
function Main() {
  return (
    <main className="col-md-10">
      <div className="frame">
        <img src="/oranda.png" alt="Oranda" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Fancy goldfish are interesting, fun additions to many tanks or ponds.
        However, they all have their own special needs and they can’t be kept
        with just any tank mates. It’s important to ensure you carefully choose
        tank mates for your fancies so avoid injury and stress. Some of them are
        weak swimmers or have poor vision, meaning they can easily be out
        competed for food and may not be able to escape bullying by other fish.
        Many fancies are becoming more popular in the aquatics trade, while
        others are rare enough that you may never see them in person. Each breed
        of fancy goldfish has its own charm and unique qualities, making them
        beautiful centerpieces for your tank.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Adding Inline CSS Style

As an alternative to using class names and an external stylesheet sometimes you may want to use inline style in order to make the style dynamic.

36. Inside the Main component, before the return statement, we will add the following object with CSS styles:

```javascript
const frameStyle = {
  background: "rgb(2,0,36)",
  background:
    "linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(9,49,121,1) 4%, rgba(0,255,239,1) 100%)",
};
```

_Note: This CSS background gradient code was created using the free online tool [CSSGradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/)._

37. Then inside the `<div className="frame">` we will add the `style=""` attribute and pass in the `frameStyle` object.

```jsx
 <div className="frame" style={frameStyle}>
```

## Including Child Components In A Parent Component

We are ready to compose of all children components into out main parent component.

38. Open the file **/src/App.jsx** and at the top of the file after the React import, add the following import code for our component files:

```javascript
import Header from "./Header";
import Sidebar from "./Sidebar";
import Main from "./Main";
```

39. Replace the comment `{/* Header will go here... */}` with a reference to our `<Header />` component. As you can see, by making our component names Uppercased, it makes it easier to tell the difference between the component `<Header />` vs. the html element `<header>`.

40. Replace the comment`{/* Sidebar will go here... */}` with a reference to our `<Sidebar />` component.

41. Replace the comment `{/* Main content will go here... */}` with a reference to our `<Main />` component.

## CSS To Make It Pretty

42. Inside **/src/App.jsx** at the top of the file below the other imports add the following line to import your `App.css` file

```javascript
import "./App.css";
```

43. Open **/src/App.css** file. Delete all of the CSS in this file because we will be adding our own code.

44. Paste the following code into the CSS file:

```css
body {
  margin: 40px;
}

header {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

header,
aside {
  text-align: center;
}

header img,
header h1 {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
}

header h1 {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.logo {
  width: 100px;
}

aside ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding-left: 20px;
}

aside li {
  padding: 7px 0;
}

main p {
  margin: 30px 0;
  column-count: auto;
  column-gap: 2em;
}

.frame {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 753px) {
  header,
  aside {
    text-align: left;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 960px) {
  main p {
    column-count: 2;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1172px) {
  main p {
    column-count: 3;
  }
}
```

46. Save all files and head to the browser to view your masterpiece.
